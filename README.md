MONOREPO for building each part of this dnd microservice shenanigans. Thought it would be a fun little project to try and get used to a monorepo setup. 

The Goal: Inventory drop pools which can be split/claimed by players. GM's will register a party, and then fill out what all the drops are into a list. The list will get sent to discord and people can click to claim individual items, while the money will be split among them. 

As the numbers will be varied, emotes, while a good idea, might have to be put to the side in favour of the classic ` $claim [number] ` format.
